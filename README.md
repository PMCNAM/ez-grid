## Overview

EZ Grid is a lightweight (<2kB), zoomable, nestable grid with support back to IE8. It can be used to rapidly prototype a layout or for production. You can choose to pull down the css file or the minified verion or you can pull down the whole repo and customize the grid using sass and grunt.

## Requirements

None for basic use. The /css/ezgrid.css or /css/min/ezgrid.min.css files can be used as is or edited.

For customizing the grid the requirements are Node.js, Grunt and Sass (Ruby).

## Getting Started

After pulling down, run 'npm install'. Then run 'grunt build' to build or 'grunt watch' to watch for changes to /scss/ezgrid.scss.
